## CVE-2024-23897
 Jenkins 2.441 and earlier, LTS 2.426.2 and earlier does not disable a feature of its CLI command parser that replaces an '@' character followed by a file path in an argument with the file's contents, allowing unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system.

## CVE-2023-38646
 Metabase open source before 0.46.6.1 and Metabase Enterprise before 1.46.6.1 allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server, at the server's privilege level. Authentication is not required for exploitation. The other fixed versions are 0.45.4.1, 1.45.4.1, 0.44.7.1, 1.44.7.1, 0.43.7.2, and 1.43.7.2.

## CVE-2023-5204
 The ChatBot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the $strid parameter in versions up to, and including, 4.8.9 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## CVE-2019-9053
 An issue was discovered in CMS Made Simple 2.2.8. It is possible with the News module, through a crafted URL, to achieve unauthenticated blind time-based SQL injection via the m1_idlist parameter.

## CVE-2018-25031
 Swagger UI before 4.1.3 could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks. By persuading a victim to open a crafted URL, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to display remote OpenAPI definitions.

## CVE-2016-0800
 The SSLv2 protocol, as used in OpenSSL before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g and other products, requires a server to send a ServerVerify message before establishing that a client possesses certain plaintext RSA data, which makes it easier for remote attackers to decrypt TLS ciphertext data by leveraging a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle, aka a &quot;DROWN&quot; attack.
