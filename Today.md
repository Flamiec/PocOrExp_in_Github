## CVE-2023-51448
 Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Version 1.2.25 has a Blind SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability within the SNMP Notification Receivers feature in the file `&#8216;managers.php&#8217;`. An authenticated attacker with the &#8220;Settings/Utilities&#8221; permission can send a crafted HTTP GET request to the endpoint `&#8216;/cacti/managers.php&#8217;` with an SQLi payload in the `&#8216;selected_graphs_array&#8217;` HTTP GET parameter. As of time of publication, no patched versions exist.

## CVE-2023-6246
 A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the __vsyslog_internal function of the glibc library. This function is called by the syslog and vsyslog functions. This issue occurs when the openlog function was not called, or called with the ident argument set to NULL, and the program name (the basename of argv[0]) is bigger than 1024 bytes, resulting in an application crash or local privilege escalation. This issue affects glibc 2.36 and newer.

## CVE-2022-1386
 The Fusion Builder WordPress plugin before 3.6.2, used in the Avada theme, does not validate a parameter in its forms which could be used to initiate arbitrary HTTP requests. The data returned is then reflected back in the application's response. This could be used to interact with hosts on the server's local network bypassing firewalls and access control measures.

## CVE-2012-4929
 The TLS protocol 1.2 and earlier, as used in Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Qt, and other products, can encrypt compressed data without properly obfuscating the length of the unencrypted data, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers by observing length differences during a series of guesses in which a string in an HTTP request potentially matches an unknown string in an HTTP header, aka a &quot;CRIME&quot; attack.
