## CVE-2024-32002
 Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, repositories with submodules can be crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/` directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed while the clone operation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. If symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work. As always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.

## CVE-2024-3961
 The ConvertKit &#8211; Email Newsletter, Email Marketing, Subscribers and Landing Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the tag_subscriber function in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to subscribe users to tags. Financial damages may occur to site owners if their API quota is exceeded.

## CVE-2023-22622
 WordPress through 6.1.1 depends on unpredictable client visits to cause wp-cron.php execution and the resulting security updates, and the source code describes &quot;the scenario where a site may not receive enough visits to execute scheduled tasks in a timely manner,&quot; but neither the installation guide nor the security guide mentions this default behavior, or alerts the user about security risks on installations with very few visits.

## CVE-2023-4220
 Unrestricted file upload in big file upload functionality in `/main/inc/lib/javascript/bigupload/inc/bigUpload.php` in Chamilo LMS &lt;= v1.11.24 allows unauthenticated attackers to perform stored cross-site scripting attacks and obtain remote code execution via uploading of web shell.

## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &quot;require all denied&quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.
