## CVE-2024-3788
 Vulnerability in WBSAirback 21.02.04, which involves improper neutralisation of Server-Side Includes (SSI), through License (/admin/CDPUsers). Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote user to execute arbitrary code.

## CVE-2023-38831
 RARLAB WinRAR before 6.23 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code when a user attempts to view a benign file within a ZIP archive. The issue occurs because a ZIP archive may include a benign file (such as an ordinary .JPG file) and also a folder that has the same name as the benign file, and the contents of the folder (which may include executable content) are processed during an attempt to access only the benign file. This was exploited in the wild in April through October 2023.

## CVE-2023-31290
 Trust Wallet Core before 3.1.1, as used in the Trust Wallet browser extension before 0.0.183, allows theft of funds because the entropy is 32 bits, as exploited in the wild in December 2022 and March 2023. This occurs because the mt19937 Mersenne Twister takes a single 32-bit value as an input seed, resulting in only four billion possible mnemonics. The affected versions of the browser extension are 0.0.172 through 0.0.182. To steal funds efficiently, an attacker can identify all Ethereum addresses created since the 0.0.172 release, and check whether they are Ethereum addresses that could have been created by this extension. To respond to the risk, affected users need to upgrade the product version and also move funds to a new wallet address.

## CVE-2023-28252
 Windows Common Log File System Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability

## CVE-2023-23607
 erohtar/Dasherr is a dashboard for self-hosted services. In affected versions unrestricted file upload allows any unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the server. The file /www/include/filesave.php allows for any file to uploaded to anywhere. If an attacker uploads a php file they can execute code on the server. This issue has been addressed in version 1.05.00. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &quot;require all denied&quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.

## CVE-2018-9995
 TBK DVR4104 and DVR4216 devices, as well as Novo, CeNova, QSee, Pulnix, XVR 5 in 1, Securus, Night OWL, DVR Login, HVR Login, and MDVR Login, which run re-branded versions of the original TBK DVR4104 and DVR4216 series, allow remote attackers to bypass authentication via a &quot;Cookie: uid=admin&quot; header, as demonstrated by a device.rsp?opt=user&amp;cmd=list request that provides credentials within JSON data in a response.
