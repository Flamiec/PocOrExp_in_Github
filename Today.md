## CVE-2024-23652
 BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts in an efficient, expressive and repeatable manner. A malicious BuildKit frontend or Dockerfile using RUN --mount could trick the feature that removes empty files created for the mountpoints into removing a file outside the container, from the host system. The issue has been fixed in v0.12.5. Workarounds include avoiding using BuildKit frontends from an untrusted source or building an untrusted Dockerfile containing RUN --mount feature.

## CVE-2024-21626
 runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from runc exec) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem (&quot;attack 2&quot;). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through runc run (&quot;attack 1&quot;). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (&quot;attack 3a&quot; and &quot;attack 3b&quot;). runc 1.1.12 includes patches for this issue.

## CVE-2024-1512
 The MasterStudy LMS WordPress Plugin &#8211; for Online Courses and Education plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to union based SQL Injection via the 'user' parameter of the /lms/stm-lms/order/items REST route in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.5 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## CVE-2019-1663
 A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied data in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of the affected device as a high-privilege user. RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall versions prior to 1.2.2.1 are affected. RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router versions prior to 1.0.3.45 are affected. RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router versions prior to 1.3.1.1 are affected.
