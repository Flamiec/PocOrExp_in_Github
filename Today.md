## CVE-2024-1642
 The MainWP Dashboard &#8211; WordPress Manager for Multiple Websites Maintenance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.6.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'posting_bulk' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## CVE-2024-0986
 A vulnerability was found in Issabel PBX 4.0.0. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /index.php?menu=asterisk_cli of the component Asterisk-Cli. The manipulation of the argument Command leads to os command injection. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-252251. NOTE: The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

## CVE-2023-51385
 In ssh in OpenSSH before 9.6, OS command injection might occur if a user name or host name has shell metacharacters, and this name is referenced by an expansion token in certain situations. For example, an untrusted Git repository can have a submodule with shell metacharacters in a user name or host name.

## CVE-2023-21253
 In multiple locations, there is a possible way to crash multiple system services due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local denial of service with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

## CVE-2022-0185
 A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the legacy_parse_param function in the Filesystem Context functionality of the Linux kernel verified the supplied parameters length. An unprivileged (in case of unprivileged user namespaces enabled, otherwise needs namespaced CAP_SYS_ADMIN privilege) local user able to open a filesystem that does not support the Filesystem Context API (and thus fallbacks to legacy handling) could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.

## CVE-2021-42013
 It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &quot;require all denied&quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not earlier versions.

## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &quot;require all denied&quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.

## CVE-2021-31630

## CVE-2021-26855
 Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

## CVE-2021-4034
 A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit's pkexec utility. The pkexec application is a setuid tool designed to allow unprivileged users to run commands as privileged users according predefined policies. The current version of pkexec doesn't handle the calling parameters count correctly and ends trying to execute environment variables as commands. An attacker can leverage this by crafting environment variables in such a way it'll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. When successfully executed the attack can cause a local privilege escalation given unprivileged users administrative rights on the target machine.

## CVE-2020-27786
 A flaw was found in the Linux kernel&#8217;s implementation of MIDI, where an attacker with a local account and the permissions to issue ioctl commands to midi devices could trigger a use-after-free issue. A write to this specific memory while freed and before use causes the flow of execution to change and possibly allow for memory corruption or privilege escalation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.

## CVE-2020-14974
 The driver in IOBit Unlocker 1.1.2 allows a low-privileged user to unlock a file and kill processes (even ones running as SYSTEM) that hold a handle, via IOCTL code 0x222124.

## CVE-2019-2215
 A use-after-free in binder.c allows an elevation of privilege from an application to the Linux Kernel. No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability, however exploitation does require either the installation of a malicious local application or a separate vulnerability in a network facing application.Product: AndroidAndroid ID: A-141720095

## CVE-2018-6242
 Some NVIDIA Tegra mobile processors released prior to 2016 contain a buffer overflow vulnerability in BootROM Recovery Mode (RCM). An attacker with physical access to the device's USB and the ability to force the device to reboot into RCM could exploit the vulnerability to execute unverified code.
