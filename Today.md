## CVE-2023-38831
 RARLAB WinRAR before 6.23 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code when a user attempts to view a benign file within a ZIP archive. The issue occurs because a ZIP archive may include a benign file (such as an ordinary .JPG file) and also a folder that has the same name as the benign file, and the contents of the folder (which may include executable content) are processed during an attempt to access only the benign file. This was exploited in the wild in April through October 2023.

## CVE-2023-38041

## CVE-2023-37250
 Unity Parsec has a TOCTOU race condition that permits local attackers to escalate privileges to SYSTEM if Parsec was installed in &quot;Per User&quot; mode. The application intentionally launches DLLs from a user-owned directory but intended to always perform integrity verification of those DLLs. This affects Parsec Loader versions through 8. Parsec Loader 9 is a fixed version.

## CVE-2023-22527
 A template injection vulnerability on older versions of Confluence Data Center and Server allows an unauthenticated attacker to achieve RCE on an affected instance. Customers using an affected version must take immediate action. Most recent supported versions of Confluence Data Center and Server are not affected by this vulnerability as it was ultimately mitigated during regular version updates. However, Atlassian recommends that customers take care to install the latest version to protect their instances from non-critical vulnerabilities outlined in Atlassian&#8217;s January Security Bulletin.
